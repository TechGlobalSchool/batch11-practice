console.log(`Alright let's do this one more time`); 
console.log(`My name is Ayah Elkossei, and I'm the one and only Spider-Woman - at least in my universe.`);
console.log(`Egyptian-American, born and raised. I grew up hearing stories about pharoahs and revolutionaries, sipping shai with too much sugar and 
sneaking out of family gatherings just to get a moment of peace. Now? I sneak out to save the city.
Funny how life works. `)
console.log(`Look I didn't ask for this. One radioactive spider - one little bite - and suddenly, I've got super strength, 
wall-crawling, the whole package. I thought I was some kind of chosen hero. Turns out? The only thing I was 
chosen for was for a whole lotta stress.`); 
console.log(`But here's the thing. Being Egyptian means carrying history on your back. My ancestors built empires,
fought invaders, led revolutions. Strength is in my blood, it's in my people.`)
console.log(`Yeah, I mess up. I get hurt. I fall. But I always get back up. That's what we do. That's what I do.`)
